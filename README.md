# PHP-X — A Cross-Platform Runtime for PHP

## Project Status

🚧 **Early-stage / Experimental**

PHP-X is currently in **active early development**.  
At this stage, the project focuses on:

- A custom PHP CLI runtime (`phpx`)
- Long-running PHP process (event-loop style)
- A minimal built-in HTTP server
- Server-side DOM control (proof of concept)
- Learning, experimentation, and architectural exploration

This repository is **not production-ready** yet.

The goal of PHP-X is to explore how PHP could evolve into a
cross-platform runtime for desktop, mobile, and server-side applications,
similar in spirit to Node.js — but with PHP at the core.

## Why this exists

This project is driven by:
- curiosity
- learning by building
- understanding runtime & framework internals
- experimenting with PHP beyond traditional web use

## Contributions

The project is currently maintained by a single developer.
Contributions, discussions, and ideas will be welcome once
the core architecture stabilizes.
